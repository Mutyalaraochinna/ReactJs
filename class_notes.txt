                                Introduction

        - React given by facebook.

        - React Categorized into 3 flavours.

                        1) ReactJS

                        2) React Native

                        3) React BootStrap

        - ReactJS, used to develop the web applications.

        - web applications we can develop in "two ways".

                1) JSX

                2) TypeScript

        - JSX stands for JavaScript + XML.

        - JSX won't follows the OOPS.

        - TypeScript is the Programming Language.

        - TypeScript follows the OOPS Features.

        - React Native, used to develop the mobile applications.

        - React BootStrap, used to apply the Rich UI to Both Web Applications and Mobile Applications.

Environmental Setup
===================

1) download and install NodeJS

        - npm is the tool, used to install the ReactJS.

        - npm stands for Node Packaging Manager.

        - npm present in NodeJS.

2) install "create-react-app" tool

        - create-react-app is the tool used to create the ReactJS Applications.

        - we will install create-react-app tool by using following command.

                > npm install -g create-react-app

        - "-g" stands for global installation

3) install Visual Studio Code.

        "VSCode" is the IDE, provided by Microsoft.

        "VSCode" IDE, Recomended IDE to Develop ReactJS Applications.


4) install yarn tool.

        > npm install -g yarn

Create and Execute the First React Application
==============================================

1) create the react application

        > npx create-react-app first-app --template typescript

        - npx stands for node packaging runner.

        - npx present in NodeJS.


2) switch to react application

        > cd first-app

3) execute the react application

        > yarn start

        - default port number of react application is 3000.


Component
=========
        - Reusable Portion of complex UI Called as component.

        - These Components are "Reusable".

        - As a React Developer, we can Provide Communbication Between Components.

        - React Applications are Component Based Applications.

        - In React, we can create two types of Components.

                1) class level components

                2) functional level components

        - class level components also called as stateful components.

        - functional level components also called as stateless components.

> npx create-react-app components-app --template typescript

> cd components-app
